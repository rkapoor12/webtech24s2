<h1>Komodo Dragon Island </h1>
<p>Welcome to Komodo Dragon Island, a rugged and remote paradise located within the Komodo National Park in Indonesia.</br>
</br>
	This mystical island is famous for being the natural habitat of the Komodo dragon, the world's largest lizard. 
Me and my family visited Komodo Dragon Island during our trip to Flores in December 2022. December is the mating season for Komodo
 Dragons which means that males are more territorial with their spaces. Thus, it was actually very difficult 
for us to spot a Komodo Dragon and we spent an hour walking around the island searching for one with our ranger. </br>
</br>
However, towards the end of our tour, we did end up seeing one which was quite large, being at least two meters long.
 It seemed to be moving quite slow and our guide instructed us to not bother it. However, we were still able to take pictures
  with it from afar. The dragon was very calm and did not seem to be bothered by our presence. Simultaneously, we also saw 
  baby dragons running around and swimming in the water. It was quite amazing to notice these creatures up close. </br>
</br>
  I would definitely recommend visiting the island to experience the incredible beauty and biodiversity of Komodo Dragon
   Island firsthand. Despite the challenges of spotting these elusive creatures during the mating season, the thrill of 
   encountering a Komodo dragon in its natural habitat is truly unforgettable.

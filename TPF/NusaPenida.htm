<h1> Nusa Penida</h1>
<p>Nusa Penida is a must – visit island, just ten minutes away by ferry from the main island of Bali! 
The island is known for its amazing views of Kelingking Beach, Angel’s Billabong and Broken Beach.  </br>
</br>
After getting off the ferry, the sites are an hour and a half drive. Be ready for steep roads, going uphill and downhill. 
My family and I first went to Angel’s Billabong and Broken Beach. Angel's Billabong is a stunning natural tide pool nestled between 
jagged rocks and cliffs. Just a short walk from Angel's Billabong is Broken Beach, another breathtaking sight. This natural marvel 
features a large natural archway. The natural bridge, formed by centuries of erosion, offers panoramic views of the surrounding coastline and ocean beyond.</br>
</br>
Just thirty minutes away from Broken Beach is Kelingking Beach. The highlight of Kelingking Beach is its iconic cliff formation,
 which resembles the head of a Tyrannosaurus Rex dinosaur when viewed from above. Visitors are allowed to trek down to the beach.
  However, the trail is  quite steep and rugged, thus requiring a lot of caution. My family and I chose to forgo the trek.</br>
</br>
  All these sites are popular tourist destinations on Nusa Penida, drawing visitors 
  from around the world with their unique beauty and awe-inspiring landscapes. Whether you're admiring the view from above
   or exploring the shoreline up close, these natural wonders are sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone lucky enough to visit.
</br>

	Travel Tips: 
<ol>
<li>Be sure to visit these sites earlier in the morning rather than later in the day as they get quite crowded. </li>	
<li>Wear sunscreen and be sure to bring a cap and extra clothes as it can get very hot (up to 30 degrees Celsius during the day)</li>
<li>Wear shoes as you may need to walk on rocks and other unstable ground </li>
<li>Pack your own lunch as food options are limited on the island! </li>
</ol>

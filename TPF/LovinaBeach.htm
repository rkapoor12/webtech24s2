<h1> Lovina Beach</h1>
<p>
	Against the breathtaking coastline of Bali, dolphin watching at Lovina Beach is an experience that gives tourists the
	 chance to see wild dolphins in their natural habitat. Most recently, I had the opportunity to experience this in December of 2023.<br> 
	 <br>
	Early in the morning is when most people go dolphin watching. We boarded a  jukung, which are traditional outrigger boats. 
	Skilled local fisherman who understand the behaviors and travel patterns of dolphins pilot these boats.<br>
	<br>
		Me and my family left for Dolphin watching at around 6 am but spent an hour only looking for the dolphins.
		 However, after an hour, we were able to spot dolphins. <br>
		 <br>
		The sight of these playful beings leaping and diving filled me with a sense of awe and wonder. 
		They were so majestic but very quick. One moment they were on the surface and a second later, back underwater.
		 They would then suddenly pop back up in a completely different area. I really wanted to also swim these dolphins. <br>
		 <br>

		Attached to these boats are wooden paddles that hang down and which you can hang on as the boat moves to snorkel. I did this 
		and got to see the dolphins swimming underwater. That view was spectacular. Unfortunately, I did not have camera
		to capture this moment, however I highly recommend that you should carry one.<br>
		<br>
		Check out this video that I took of the dolphins!

  <h1> Project Proposal </h1>
</html>

<h2> Objective of my website  </h2>

<p>
	
	The project objective will be to showcase my travel experiences and personal reviews of the places that I have visited.
	 The website will allow users to look at various sites that I recommend that they should visit in each place. This will be demonstrated with a sample of three cities/places that I have 
	 visited with pictures that I have taken during the trip as well.  

</p>

<h2> Target Audience of my website  </h2>	

<p>
	My website is to help travel enthusiasts learn more about tourism opportunities in Indonesia and Spain. I hope to encourage them 
	to travel to these places through providing them with a guide of what they can do  while they are visiting.

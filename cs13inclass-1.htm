        <!-- PROBLEM ONE-->

        <h1> Using inputs with conditional statements -1 </h1>
        <h3> This is a complex problem. So, we will start with a simpler version
            and complicate it later. We will go through multiple simple steps to get there.
            Please follow along carefully because each step will illustrate the different ways
            to write conditional statements in JavaScript.
        </h3>
        <div>
            <p> 
                Start simple. When the user clicks on the button, ask the user for a number
                between 1 and 9, both inclusive. If the number is less than 5, change the color
                of the BUTTON to green. If greater than 5, change it to red. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When the user clicks on the button below, ask the user for a number between 1 and 9 both inclusive.
                If the number is between 1 and 4 (both inclusive) change the button color to green.
                If the number is between 6 and 9 (both inclusive) change the button color to red
                if the number is exactly 5, change the color to yellow.
                if the number is outside the range,i.e, less than 1 or more than 9, change the button to black.
            </p>
            <button id="b1" onclick="valNum()" style="width:200px; height:100px">Problem 1</button>
